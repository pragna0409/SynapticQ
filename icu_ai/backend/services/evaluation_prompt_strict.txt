Evaluate this hackathon project AS A STRICT, CRITICAL JUDGE:

CRITICAL SCORING GUIDELINES - READ CAREFULLY:
- Be HARSH but CONSTRUCTIVE in your evaluation
- Most hackathon projects should score between 20-70 overall
- Only truly exceptional, production-ready projects with clear innovation deserve 80+
- Scores of 90+ are EXTREMELY rare (reserved for top 1% projects that could become startups)
- Consider: Is this actually innovative or just combining existing tools?
- Consider: Is the execution polished or just a basic prototype?
- Consider: Does it solve a real problem or is it a toy/demo project?

SCORING SCALE (be realistic):
- 9-10: Industry-leading quality, could be a funded startup (very rare)
- 7-8: Excellent execution with clear winner potential
- 5-6: Good effort, solid hackathon project (most projects)
- 3-4: Basic prototype, needs significant work
- 1-2: Incomplete or poorly executed

Be specific, actionable, and REALISTIC. Don't inflate scores - be a tough but fair judge who wants to see real improvement.
